# Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Question-Answering Task
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methodology is a powerful tool for improving Question-answering systems. 
Combining the generative capabilities of LLM with extraction mechanisms can significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of responses, especially in domains with high specificity.
## Project plan 
1. Cleaning the raw text 
2. Building word embeddings
3. Initialization of the vector database 
4. User query conversion and vector database search 
5. Generating a response
